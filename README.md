# Angry Patterns

This is a game inspired by Angry Birds created as a Semestral Project for the course NI-ADP (Architecture and Design Patterns) at FIT CTU in Prague.

The goal of this project is to create a functional MVC game while practicing implementing different design patterns.

## Design Patterns

Design patterns used throughout this project:

- **Abstract Factory** - creating different types of cannons, missiles
- **Bridge** - supporting other libraries (other than ScalaFX)
- **Command** - user input changing model
- **Memento** - rewinding actions back
- **Null Object** - app doesn't crash if certain objects are null
- **Observer** - rerendering the scene on change
- **Proxy** - controls access to game model
- **Singleton** - restricting some object creation
- **State** - different shooting modes
- **Strategy** - different missile moving strategies
- **Visitor** - adds rendering functionalities to game objects

## Features

- **Moving cannon**
- **Aiming cannon up/down**
- **Powering cannon up/down**
- **Different shooting modes**
- **Different missile moving strategies**
- **Rewinding back**
